# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a fun way to practice basic web development skills.

## Features

- User can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects a choice.
- The result is displayed, indicating whether the user won, lost, or tied.
- Basic styling for an enhanced user experience.

## Installation

No installation is needed. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
2. Click on one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to make your choice.
3. The game will display the computer's choice and the result of the round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styles the game for a pleasant user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic and user interactions.

## How It Works

1. The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking a button.
2. JavaScript captures the user's choice and generates a random choice for the computer.
3. The game logic compares both choices and determines the winner.
4. The result is displayed on the screen.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a scoring system to keep track of the user's and computer's scores.
- Enhance the UI with animations and more advanced CSS styling.
- Allow the user to set a maximum score to determine the overall winner.
